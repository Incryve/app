# Rental Database Project
  Hey there, fellow coders! ðŸ‘‹   
  
  Welcome to my latest adventure in the tech world! 
  This project is a unique blend of skills and passions, 
  combining my journey through the **Code Girls First SQL Database** course 
  with the backend mastery gained through a **Santander Group scholarship in Java Backend by Dio**.

  I've taken the database I created for a film equipment rental service 
  and am supercharging it with a Java Spring Boot API, using Gradle as my trusty build tool. 
  And guess what? Then I'm taking my baby to the cloud with Railway!

  Please, feel free to test and send me any comments or suggestions!
